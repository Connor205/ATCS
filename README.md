# ATCS
All projects and files from my ATCS class during my senior year at Menlo School.  
The class contained some simple starter projects and then left us to our own creativity. 
# Exciting Projects
The main projects to note are my final project, a poker odds calculator for given hands, can be seen [here](https://github.com/Connor205/ATCS/tree/master/ATCS%20Final%20Project).
